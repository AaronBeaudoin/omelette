# Omelette

**Omelette** is an opinionated _recipe_ that [demonstrates](https://omelette.snackbar.workers.dev) how to build a fast dynamic website/application. It was created as a foundation for a real-world ecommerce website and jump-starts you with:

- A **flexible architecture** suitable for production websites.
- Hand-picked **tools and libraries** for painless development.
- A cost-effective and scalable **preset deployment platform**.

This website is not only _built with_ Omelette, it actually _is_ Omelette itself!
