# 1. BUILD
# Run NPM build script, just like you do locally to preview.
# This generates the `dist/` directory in Vercel's build environment.
npm run build

# 2. PREPARE
# Remove existing `.vercel/` directory (if applicable).
# Create a new `.vercel/` directory.
rm -rf .vercel
mkdir -p .vercel/output

# 3. STRUCTURE
# Copy the `.vercel/output/` directory skeleton from `vercel/output/`.
# Copy client build output to `.vercel/output/static/` directory.
cp -a vercel/output/. .vercel/output
cp -a dist/client/. .vercel/output/static
